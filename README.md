📝 Project Description:
This project is a Product Inventory System developed using C# and SQLite. It consists of four main interfaces that include listing, managing, and user login validation of products:

Login Screen
Homepage (Main Menu)
Manage Items
List Items

Initially, SQL Server was used; however, due to portability issues, it was switched to SQLite. The application can run on different computers and will automatically create a database if it is missing.
Key Features of the Project:

🔑 Login Screen: Users can log in with a specified username and password. A warning is displayed when incorrect information is entered, and the user is greeted upon successful login.
📋 Item List: This screen displays all products but does not allow editing or adding items.
🛠️ Item Management: Features for adding new products and editing existing ones are provided.
📂 Database Management: Using SQLite, the system automatically creates a new database if a suitable one does not exist.
📝 Placeholder Support: Gray explanations appear in empty fields and disappear when focused on.
🏠 Main Menu: Users can navigate between pages and exit the application.
🧹 Code Optimization: Unnecessary code has been removed, and explanatory comments have been added for each section.

Technologies and Tools:

Programming Language: C#
Database: SQL Server → SQLite
Development Environment: Visual Studio
Other Tools: Git, YouTube resources, ChatGPT support
